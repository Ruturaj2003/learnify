## About The Quiz Analysis

We always just tell which was wrong answer or just tell a simple explation about the correct answer , but i dont think we actually analze the worng asnwer and tell why it was worng

Basically , u should know why your asnwers wasnt correct , not just what is the right answer

## time of Answer review

Let user decide if they want review after every question or at the end of the quiz
You could even add a "Hybrid Mode" where users get instant feedback for wrong answers but wait until the end for correct ones.
Track confidence levels and prioritize explanations based on uncertain answers.
